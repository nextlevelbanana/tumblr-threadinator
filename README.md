#How to Use

1. Give each thread a tag that starts with "rp:". You don't have to tag every post in a reblog chain, but doesn't hurt. If you start a new post and link back to the original, you DO need to tag it.
2. For maximal assurance that your post will be included, tag your rp partner in it. (This is mostly necessary for anon asks and other initial posts that aren't answers to named asks. But better safe than sorry.)
3. Go to the dumb page and give me your list of tags.
4. At the moment it probably doesn't work if your thread is more than 20 posts long, or if you have more than 300 threads. But I'm gettin there.
