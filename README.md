A tool for Tumblr rpers that automatically generates and updates a page of links to all your threads. NOTE: this was a one-off weekend project, it's pretty rough, but it mostly works! If you want to use it, message me and I'll walk you through setup.

How to Use

1. Give each thread a tag that starts with "rp:". You don't have to tag every post in a reblog chain, but doesn't hurt. If you start a new post and link back to the original, you DO need to tag it.
2. For maximal assurance that your post will be included, tag your rp partner in it. (This is mostly necessary for anon asks and other initial posts that aren't answers to named asks. But better safe than sorry.)
3. Go to https://www.tumblr.com/mega-editor/published/[blog-name], right click, View Source, search for "source", and send me the list.
4. At the moment it probably doesn't work if your thread is more than 20 posts long, or if you have more than 300 threads. I'll fix it if someone actually wants to use it.
